# Webfoot
Elifoot 98, reimagined (kind of) for the web

## Motivations

1. Experiment with [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/)'s reactivity system
2. Tinker with [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) as client-side storage
3. Have fun!

## About Elifoot 98
Elifoot 98 was a game launched when I was 6 but I only started playing it 2 years later. By the time, I was starting to love football (soccer) and playing Fifa or other football games was still too complex to me.
I still remember the moment I got to know Elifoot and played for the first time in my uncle's laptop at the beach. I was completely hooked and kept coming back during the years. I had enjoyed Championship Manager and Football Manager as a grown up teen, but the simplicity of Elifoot still is very seductive.

With Elifoot, you can sell/buy players, renew contracts, select your formation and go to the match. Within 15 minutes you can play a whole season!

## Why that tech stack?

Since Elifoot 98 had a very basic UI and no in-match simulation, a reactive framework suits the project very nicely. In order to store the game data, such as teams, players, trainers, league fixtures and so on, a persistent storage layer that has an API ready to use also makes sense. I'm using this project to
build my first football manager trying to be as close to the original concept as possible. When I'm done, I plan to work in a more evolved simulator using the knowledge that I acquire in this first journey.

In order to have the same old-style feel, I'll be using [98.css](https://jdan.github.io/98.css/) design system to emulate the UI that I played on Windows 98 back in the day.

To be Updated!
